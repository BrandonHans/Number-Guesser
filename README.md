# Number-Guesser
Guess the right number to win the game.
This program is a simple number guesser game that generates a random number every time the program is initialized. 
If the users guess is too low, the program will tell the user to guess higher.
If the users guess is too high, the program will tell the user to guess lower.
The user only has 5 guesses and after the fifth incorrect guess, the program ends.
